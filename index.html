            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">Extremely poor customer service</li>
                <li class="list-text">Excessive waiting times for telephone support</li>
                <li class="list-text">When you do get through the operator is clearly overseas with very poor language skills and there is a rooster usually crowing in the background</li>
                <li class="list-text">The My Telstra App fails to login 7 out of 10 times and Telstra offers absolutely no support for this App</li>
                <li class="list-text">When the App happens to work, and you message Telstra and after waiting anything up to 2 hours for a reply. The support person takes you around and around by repeatedly repeating what you've said to confirm that's what you've said (it is infuriating). Then they transfer you because they have no idea how to help you, but the new person cannot access the discussion and you have to start all over again!</li>
                <li class="list-text">Tech support is almost impossible to get, or it takes hours and hours to get an answer</li>
                <li class="list-text">Very few stores and if there are any problems, they say call Telstra or refer you to the My Telstra App</li>
                <li class="list-text">Telstra's websites are poorly laid out, buggy and difficult to use</li>
                <li class="list-text">Purchasing anything online results in questions which take hours to get answered</li>
                <li class="list-text">NBN service regularly goes down or the modem fails and needs to be restarted</li>
                <li class="list-text">Telstra cannot measure the products they sell such as an iPhone Pro - they claim a Pro is 6.7" - there is nowhere on this model that is 6.7"</li>
            </ul>
